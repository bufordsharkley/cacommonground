# Value Capture

Land value capture is a tool used around the world to recapture the land value
gains from public investment in the built environment. Transit, affordable
housing and social services are some of the beneficiaries in successful land
value capture programs.

Common Ground California recommends the State of California, its local
governments, transit operators incorporate value capture as a centerpiece in
contemplated expansions of public transit.
