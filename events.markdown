      <h4>"Who Owns The Earth?" at the San Francisco Public Library</h4>
      <h5>10/12/19 - 12/28/19</h5>
        <p class="about-text">
Who owns the earth? Why is there so much poverty amid so much wealth? Who has
the right to profit from nature? This exhibit highlights the life and work of
Henry George, the social theorist and economist, who observed this paradox 140
years ago while living and working in San Francisco. His book Progress and
Poverty (1879) stirred his generation to question social inequities during the
Gilded Age as the pockets of land barons and railroad monopolists fattened off
the natural wealth in land. George’s keen analyses offered a simple
solution—reinvest the economic value of land back into the society that created
it.

Progress and Poverty became an international bestseller with translations in
more than 30 languages. George's ideas are still relevant today as the San
Francisco Bay Area grapples with the highest land values and rents in the
nation and unprecedented homelessness. This exhibit contains original written
works by George, as well as photos and ephemera that show how his theories
reverberated over time.
