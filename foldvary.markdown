California Common Ground  is saddened  by the loss of  Dr. Fred Foldvary, an
esteemed and  long-time member of our organization, our former Vice President
and  an inspirational advocate of Henry George’s philosophy. We hold in our
hearts his memory and extend our deepest sympathy to his family.

Dr. Foldvary is notably  distinguished for going on record in the [American
Journal of Economics and Sociology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1536-7150.1997.tb02657.x/abstract)
in 1997 to predict the exact timing of the 2008 economic depression—eleven
years before the event occurred. He was able to
do so due to his extensive knowledge of the real-estate cycle. Dr. Foldvary’s
research focused on  universal ethics, public revenue from land rent, community
associations, and business cycles.

Dr. Foldvary received his B.A. in economics from the University of California
at Berkeley, and his M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from George Mason University.
He has taught economics at Virginia Tech, John F. Kennedy University, Latvian
University of Agriculture, Santa Clara University, and at San Jose State
University.

Dr. Foldvary also wrote on topics including ending slavery in chocolate
plantations; a green tax shift to protect the environment while enhancing the
economy; reforming democracy with small-group voting; and solving territorial
conflict with confederations and the payment of rent for occupied land.

---------------

After retiring from teaching at the university level, Dr. Foldvary continued
with online seminars  and classes including his association with the Henry
George School of New York, The Council of Georgist Organizations and Common
Ground USA. Dr. Foldvary also served on the Board of The Robert Schalkenbach
Foundation .

Dr. Foldvary’s published books include The Soul of Liberty, Public Goods and
Private Communities, Dictionary of Free-Market Economics, and The Depression of
2008.

In a 2011 paper, Dr. Mason Gaffney, Professor Emeritus of Economics at UC
Riverside, criticized the economic community for excluding and ignoring
Foldvary
