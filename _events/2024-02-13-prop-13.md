Webinar panel about how California's property tax system exacerbates housing
unaffordability and poor public services, and how to fix it.

Today, California faces record homelessness, a declining population, and
frequent budget shortfalls, despite a booming economy. How did we get here, and
what can we do to fix this? At this event, we'll hear from Stephen Hoskins
(Schalkenbach Foundation), California Assemblymember Alex Lee (D-Milpitas), and
Ben Grieff (Executive Director, Evolve CA) about the critical role California's
property tax system plays in these concurrent crises, with an eye towards
political solutions (hint: Land Value Tax would fix this).
