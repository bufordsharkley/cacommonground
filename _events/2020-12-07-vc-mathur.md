Join us on Monday, December 7th, 2020, at 7pm in a Zoom meetup to discuss
various topics related to the results of the November election and what we're
doing to continue to advocate for land value capture in California.

We're also excited to have a special guest presentation by Dr. Shishir Mathur
of the San Jose University Mineta Transportation Institute. Dr. Mathur will
present on the impact of the Warm Springs BART station on the value of
neighboring residential properties in Fremont, CA.
