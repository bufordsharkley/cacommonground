Mary Rose Kaczorowski, President, California Chapter of Common Ground USA and exhibit guest curator: Who Owns The Earth? Henry George’s Progress & Poverty 140 Years Later.

On the 140th anniversary of Henry George’s Progress and Poverty, his land tax and radical reform of land use are worth a critical re-examination. Geographer Richard Walker along with Ted Gwartney of the California chapter of Common Ground USA, untangle what George proposed, what happened as a result of his ideas, and what the future holds. In conjunction with the San Francisco Public Library exhibit Who Owns the Earth? Henry George’s Progress & Poverty 140 Years Later (October 12- December 28, 2019).
