Value Capture & Equity for Northern California's Megaregional Rail Plan

Weâ€™re thrilled with the new publication from Link21 outlining innovative
strategies to use land value capture to achieve equity, [which you can read here](https://link21program.org/en/media/249/download?inline)

Our event features program representatives from Link21 speaking on the
development of new regional transit, and how value capture can be used
to avoid displacement and finance important infrastructure and services.
