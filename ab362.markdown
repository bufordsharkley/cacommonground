# Land Value Tax on the March in California


On February 1, 2023, Assemblymember Alex Lee introduced [Assembly Bill
362](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB362#99INT),
a bill  that would require the state Department of Tax and Fee Administration to
“conduct or commission a study on the efficacy of a statewide land value
taxation system as an alternative to the current appraisal methods utilized for
real property taxation.” In his bill announcement [on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/alex_lee/status/1620905838184644615),
Assemblymember Lee noted a land value tax would “provide fairer assessments,
boost housing supply, and give more freedom to landowners to build on
properties without the fear of increasing taxes.” The bill has been introduced
in the California State Assembly, but has yet to be appear before any committees.

This proposal creates an exciting opportunity for both state legislators and
the public to engage and learn about the benefits of land value taxation.  With
a state [budget
deficit](https://calmatters.org/california-budget/2023/01/california-budget-newsom-deficit/)
of over $22 billion, continuously growing rents and home prices, and the
pressing need for green energy and transportation investments,
the necessity of land value taxation has never been more clear.  Although
this is just a study bill, it offers a unique opportunity for Georgists and
housing advocates to organize and educate the public about the benefits of
moving to a land value tax.

Proposition 13, which put a cap on property taxes at the point of purchase, has
inflicted decades of austerity on public services in California.  It has
also allowed landlords to hoard urban real estate, collect a land value
windfall, and pay a pittance in taxes.  A growing coalition of labor unions and
community organizations are beginning to push back, advocating for reforming
this unjust tax system and taking the power away from wealthy, landed
interests.  This came to a head with Proposition 15, the split roll property
tax voter initiative, which unfortunately narrowly lostat the ballot box in 2020.
However, a narrow loss in a year where an unprecedented pandemic
prevented proper campaigning shows a clear growing constituency for reforming
our system of real estate taxation. AB 362 offers a chance to shift the
conversation towards an even more equitable form of taxation that encourages
increasing housing supply, discourages real estate speculation, and collects
enough revenue for needed investments in our cities.  It also allows us to have
a broader conversation about not only what we want to prioritize in our tax
system but what kind of cities we want to build and how we can share the
benefits of urban growth.

If passed, AB 362 would provide valuable research about the benefits of land
value taxation as well as how it could potentially work in California.  There
are many hurdles and a long road ahead before California will seriously be able
to tackle the power and wealth of landlords, but further research would help
provide a roadmap on how to get us there and provide compelling information
allowing us to grow our coalition and make the case to the public. We applaud
Assemblymember Lee on his decision to author this bill and start an important
conversation about how to build communities that work for everyone, not just
the wealthy few.
