        <p class="about-text">
The mission of our California Chapter of <a
href="http://commonground-usa.net/">Common Ground USA</a> is to explore and
advocate reforms that enable our state and local governments to efficiently
finance public services and infrastructure while protecting natural resources.

        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
 We believe that changes in California’s property tax system can improve access
 to housing, and sustainably finance the infrastructure that we all depend
 upon: streets and sidewalks; waste management; water, sewer, and stormwater
 systems; public transit; police, fire, and ambulance service; parks;
 libraries; public health; planning and zoning; education.

        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
Our members work to educate about how a tax on the value of land—ie, a levy
that, unlike a property tax, does not vary with the number of houses, or
apartments or office buildings built on. Land Value Taxation  can  help
mitigate market swings in real estate by separating the more stable value of
the land from the buildings in creating a manageable system for real estate
taxation.

        <p class="about-text">

<a href="http://commonground-usa.net/">Common Ground USA</a> is dedicated to
the principle that all persons have equal and common rights in the earth and
its resources and each individual has an
exclusive right to the income from his or her own labor and capital investment.
We are also dedicated to support and improve the free market, including
purchase, ownership, and sale of real estate.
</p>

        <p class="about-text">
Therefore, we are committed to reducing and replacing taxes on labor and
capital. We propose to pay for essential government services by adequate
taxation of the value of land and other natural resources. We also propose fees
for pollution, resource extraction, and use of the public commons. We believe
these changes will increase total wealth and equality of opportunity, thereby
improving the quality of life for all individuals and the functioning of
government.
